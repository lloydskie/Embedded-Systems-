# Coconut Decorticator Machine

This project contains Arduino-based automation and sensor control systems for coconut decortication. It includes multiple sketches for brake systems, temperature control, capacitive sensors, and more.

## Features
- Automatic brake system control
- Temperature-based brake system
- Solenoid-based brake system
- Capacitive sensor integration
- Thermistor-based temperature sensing
- Relay control for automation

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- Relays, solenoids, capacitive sensors, thermistors
- Servo motors (for brake systems)
- Breadboard, jumper wires
- Power supply
