- CodeBlocks project files for easy setup

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC, MinGW, MSVC, etc.)
- CodeBlocks IDE (optional)
- VS Code or other C++ IDE

## Setup Instructions
1. Open `main.cpp` in your preferred C++ IDE.
2. Build the project using provided files or your own build system.
3. Run the executable (`main.exe`) to test the program.

## Usage
