# Practice C++

This folder contains C++ practice code and executables for learning, experimenting, and testing algorithms. It includes sample projects, build files, and binaries.

## Features
- Sample C++ programs for basic and advanced concepts
- Ready-to-run executables
- CodeBlocks project files for easy setup
- Organized by project folders (`one`, `two`)

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC, MinGW, MSVC, etc.)
- CodeBlocks IDE (optional)
- VS Code or other C++ IDE

## Folder Details
- `one/`: First sample project with `main.cpp`, build files, and binaries
- `two/`: Second sample project with `main.cpp` and executable

## Setup Instructions
1. Open `main.cpp` in your preferred C++ IDE.
2. Build the project using provided files or your own build system.
3. Run the executable (`main.exe`) to test the program.

## Usage
- Modify the code to experiment with algorithms and logic.
- Use provided executables for quick testing.

## License
Educational use only.
