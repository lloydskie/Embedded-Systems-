# Smart Bridge

This project contains an Arduino sketch for a smart bridge system, featuring automation and sensor integration for monitoring and control.

## Features
- Automated bridge control
- Sensor-based monitoring (e.g., load, position)
- Real-time feedback and alerts

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- Sensors (load, position, etc.)
- Actuators (motors, relays)
- Jumper wires, breadboard

## Setup Instructions
1. Open `SNART_BRIDGEsketch_mar13a.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Connect hardware as described in code comments.
3. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
4. Test the system and monitor sensor feedback.

## Usage
- Use the sketch for smart bridge automation and monitoring.
- Adjust code parameters for your specific hardware setup.

## License
Educational use only.
